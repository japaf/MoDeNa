The input files should be located in the `inputs` folder. `foamAging.json` controls aging simulation, whereas `foamConductivity.json` controls foam conductivity simulation. `init_foamConductivity.json` provides initial points for the initialization of foamConductivity.

### Preparing foamAging.json
The following key-pairs should be defined:
- `modelType`: "homogeneous" model first estimates effective foam diffusivity using analytical model, and then simulates diffusion of blowing agents through foam. "heterogeneous" model represents foam as a series of parallel polymer walls separated by gas cells and simulates diffusion of blowing agents directly in this foam. ["homogeneous","heterogeneous"]
